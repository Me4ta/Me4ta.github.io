							<h2>Profile</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="yui-u">
							<p class="enlarge">
								Passionate about Quality Assurance and UI automation. I have strong analytical skills and experience. What makes a good QA person good? Good QA should have a kind of feel if things are done right or not and I have that. When I see some UX or UI problems I can't stop thinking about them, it drives me crazy until I get it done right. I am a kind of person that will take quality of your product very seriously and sometimes even personal.

								<div class="skill">
									<h2>QA Automation</h2>
                                    <p>I know <code>Selenium</code>, able to write automation scripts using <code>Python</code> with Firefox and Chrome <code>Web Driver</code> implementations. I know how to test <code>single-page applications</code> with all their complexity, explicit waits and partial updates. I am familiar with <code>Unit Testing</code> frameworks and Test Runners, I understand what assertion library is and importance of readable assertions. I have experience in creating small test-frameworks to simplify writing of automation scripts.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="skill">
									<h2>Black-box Testing</h2>
									<p>I am good at manual testing and finding bugs, able to write good test cases and easy to follow steps to reproduce. Worked with <code>JIRA</code> and couple of home-grown bug tracking tools. While I prefer to automate this process, I understand that manual testing is essential part and no automation script can replace a human.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="skill">
									<h2>Software Development</h2>
									<p>Familiar with common development cycle, Continuous Integration and <code>SCRUM</code>.
                                        Have experience in leading and managing team with up to 12 members. I also know <code>Python</code>, a little bit of <code>Java</code> and <code>C</code>. Learned <code>C</code> just for fun, use <code>Python</code> at work and learning <code>Java</code> now since it's most demanded language on the market for automation engineer.</p>
